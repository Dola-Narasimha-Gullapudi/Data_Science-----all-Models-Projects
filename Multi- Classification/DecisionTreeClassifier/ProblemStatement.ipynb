    "Is to identify products at risk of backorder before the event occurs so that business has time to react. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Backorder?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Backorders are products that are temporarily out of stock, but a customer is permitted to place an order against future inventory. \n",
    "* A backorder generally indicates that customer demand for a product or service exceeds a companyâ€™s capacity to supply it. \n",
    "* Back orders are bad. Strong demand can drive back orders, but so can suboptimal planning. \n",
